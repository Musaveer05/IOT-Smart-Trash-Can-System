This is a MERN stack developed application that interacts with IoT hardware in real-time to collect data on trash bin fill levels and the stored the threshold values in blockchain contract deployed on remix ide along with timestamp. MQTT is utilized as a broker for facilitating communication between the application and the IoT devices.

The IT infrastructure utilizes MQTT for facilitating communication from sensors to software, transmitting data. Additionally, it leverages the Google Maps API to retrieve real-time location data for trash bins.
